| On 2016, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma a blood cancer, and I underwent chemotheraphy. **On March 1st, the cancer returned, and I've started another chemotheraphy treatment on March 23rd, 2021.** This can explain my slow response in some cases. If you would like more details, [I have a blog for it](https://mariuzzo.com/cancer). Happy coding!
